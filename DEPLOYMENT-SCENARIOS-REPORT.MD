# IDS Testbed and deployments report

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 What is a Data Space? 

#### 1.2 What are cool use cases and why do we need data spaces?
The International Data Spaces standard enables cross-company business processes known as use cases. These use cases play a crucial role in identifying, analyzing, and evaluating user requirements for IDS. Moreover, by implementing a use case, companies can foster innovation and create an ecosystem by involving internal and external stakeholders in the development of smart value-added services. Use cases serve as the fuel for data spaces, which act as the engine. They facilitate and expedite the creation of cross-domain and cross-country data spaces with numerous participants.
[Data Spaces Overview](https://internationaldataspaces.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/Data_Spaces_Radar_Web_230307.pdf) brochure that is available via [Most Important Documents](https://internationaldataspaces.org/publications/most-important-documents/) page of IDSA Website lists the use cases along with the challenges they are tackling, the success stories behind and the components used in each scenario to enable data sharing in a secure and sovereign way. This document gets updated on an annual basis.

## 2. Foundation - Terms and Definitions
[IDS Glossary](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G/tree/main/Glossary) acts as the ultimate source of truth for terms and definitions. 
* there are different things to be known before
* what do you want to do
  * Testing for validation
  * testing for playing around
  * testing for extension
  * providing services

### 2.1 IDS Reference testbed
[IDS Testbed](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed) is an invaluable tool for ensuring that components conform to the IDS specifications for connection and communication. It is a setup that utilizes Open Source IDS components and enables organizations to verify that their own components work interoperably with other IDS components within the testbed. The testbed provides organizations with the ability to conduct component behavior testing and interoperability testing against various IDS components (such as the Connector, DAPS, CA, and Metadata Broker).

Moreover, the IDS Testbed is also a great place to start preparing for IDS certification. By utilizing the testbed, organizations can thoroughly test their components and ensure that they meet the necessary requirements for IDS certification. The testbed can help organizations identify any issues with their components before they are certified, thereby minimizing any potential disruptions during the certification process.

In addition to testing and certification, the IDS Testbed can also serve as a starting point for creating data spaces. The testbed provides a framework for organizations to begin building their own data spaces with confidence. By ensuring interoperability and compatibility between various components, organizations can have a solid foundation upon which to build their data spaces. The IDS Testbed is a powerful tool that enables organizations to develop, test, and certify components and data spaces that adhere to the IDS specifications and work seamlessly with other IDS components.

### 2.2 Deployment scenarios
* differentiate between
  * complex technologic additions
  * "just" usage of technologies, like a connector being used by an organization in projects, for various purposes
  
#### 2.2.1 How to join in to Deployment scenarios, call to action
Why should one share a deployment scenario? Because we are in the early steps of the technology. 
What advantages does it provide? More visibility, your experiment will be exposed to more people. Potential contributors.

### 2.3 Testbeds
