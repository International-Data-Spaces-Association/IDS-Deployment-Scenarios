# IDS Testbed and deployments report

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 What is a Data Space? 

#### 1.2 What are cool use cases and why do we need data spaces?
The International Data Spaces standard enables cross-company business processes known as use cases. These use cases play a crucial role in identifying, analyzing, and evaluating user requirements for IDS. Moreover, by implementing a use case, companies can foster innovation and create an ecosystem by involving internal and external stakeholders in the development of smart value-added services. Use cases serve as the fuel for data spaces, which act as the engine. They facilitate and expedite the creation of cross-domain and cross-country data spaces with numerous participants.
[Data Spaces Overview] brochure that is available via [Most Important Documents] page of IDSA Website lists the use cases along with the challenges they are tackling, the success stories behind and the components used in each scenario to enable data sharing in a secure and sovereign way. This document gets updated on an annual basis.

#### 1.3 Technically speaking, what is a data space?

#### 1.5 MVDS, what are the services we need?

## 2. Foundation - Terms and Definitions
[IDS Glossary](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G/tree/main/Glossary) acts as the ultimate source of truth for terms and definitions. 
* there are different things to be known before
* what do you want to do
  * Testing for validation
  * testing for playing around
  * testing for extension
  * providing services

### 2.1 IDS Reference testbed
[IDS Testbed](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed) is a setup with Open Source IDS components which can be used to verify that a component implements the IDS specifications for establishing connections and communication, thus is able to work interoperable with all IDS components in the testbed setup.

It can be used for: 
- Component behaviour testing
- Interoperability testing against IDS components (Connector, DAPS, CA, Metadata Broker)
- Preparation for IDS certification
- Starting point for creation of data spaces

### 2.2 Deployment scenarios
* differentiate between
  * complex technologic additions
  * "just" usage of technologies, like a connector being used by an organization in projects, for various purposes
  
#### 2.2.1 How to join in to Deployment scenarios, call to action
Why should one share a deployment scenario? Because we are in the early steps of the technology. 
What advantages does it provide? More visibility, your experiment will be exposed to more people. Potential contributors.

### 2.3 Testbeds
* list and describe the testbeds

## 3. IDS Assets & Relationships
brief introduction, how to read this section
* Relationship of IDSA Assets: How one can use them and at what stage of development? (End User Perspective)
* Relationship of IDSA Assets: How do they interact with each other? (IDSA Perspective)
* include cool figures from Anil and Christoph
