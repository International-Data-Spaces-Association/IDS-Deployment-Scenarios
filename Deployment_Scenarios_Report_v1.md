#### Connectors


#### MVDS, what are the services we need


#### How to join in to Deployment scenarios, call to action


## Foundation - terms and defintions
* there are different things to be known before
* what do you want to do
  * Testing for validation
  * testing for playing around
  * testing for extension
  * provindg services
* Any other ideas?
* include cool figures from Anil and Christoph

## Overview
brief introduction, how to read this section

### IDS Reference testbed
[IDS Testbed](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed) is a setup with Open Source IDS components which can be used to verify that a component implements the IDS specifications for establishing connections and communication, thus is able to work interoperable with all IDS components in the testbed setup.

It can be used for: 
- Component behaviour testing
- Interoperability testing against IDS components (Connector, DAPS, CA, Metadata Broker)
- Preparation for IDS certification
- Starting point for creation of data spaces

### Deployment scenarios
* differentiate between
  * complex technologic additions
  * "just" usage of technologies, like a connector being used by an organization in projects, for various purposes

### Testbeds
* list and describe the testbeds

## Outlook and next steps
