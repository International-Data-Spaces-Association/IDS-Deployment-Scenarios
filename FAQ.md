# What is an IDS deployment scenario?
An IDS deployment scenario is a description of the steps and processes involved in delivering a component or a set of components to end-users. It outlines the various stages of deployment, from development and testing to release and optionally maintenance. The scenario typically includes information on the prerequisites (such as hardware and software requirements), configuration settings, and any necessary third-party integrations. It also includes details on the deployment environment, such as whether it will be installed on-premises or in the cloud, and how the system will be monitored and supported once it is live. A deployment scenario helps ensure that the deployment process is consistent, easily repeatable, reusable and efficient, and that the system is deployed in a way that meets the needs of end-users.

---

# What could be considered as an IDS deployment scenario?
A deployment scenario can be considered as any implementation made with IDS-compliant components:

- that allows sovereign data sharing (as defined by IDSA)
- is built with a clear purpose, to solve a problem
- is adequately documented to enable others to follow the same path

---

# What are the possible ways to create an IDS deployment scenario?
AN IDS deployment scenario could be created in several ways. Whether the developer implements a IDS-compliant component (or a set of IDS-compliant components), it can be created by:
- Adding a component to a set of components
- Changing/replacing a component in a pre-existing setup of components
- Changing all the components within a setup of components
- Create an entire new setup (with at least one IDS-compliant component)

---

# Is an IDS deployment scenario just about implementing solutions where all components comply with IDS standard? 
An IDS deployment scenario goes beyond just implementing solutions that comply with IDS. It's also about leveraging the latest tools and technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Analytics, ETL tools, and more. The aim is to solve a problem comprehensively, not just through the use of IDS, but also by combining other tools and services. Therefore, it's crucial to address key questions such as how the integration was achieved, the challenges that were encountered, resolved and the benefits gained from incorporating additional tools and services. A successful deployment scenario must involve a holistic approach that leverages various technologies and tools to create a comprehensive solution that delivers optimal results.

---

# What is the importance of sharing IDS deployment scenarios?
In all technologies in this early-adoption phase, sharing experiments and deployment scenarios play a crucial role in the technology's evolution. The sharing of best practices and deployment scenarios is particularly important in the case of data spaces, as it is a complex and evolving technology. Sharing deployment scenarios can help others learn from your experiences and avoid common mistakes. It can also facilitate the creation of standards and best practices, which can help drive the adoption and development of data spaces. By sharing their experiences and best practices, early adopters can help build a strong and collaborative community of data space practitioners, which will be critical to the success of this emerging technology.

---

# How can i share a deployment scenario?
In two ways:
- By sending a pull request via IDS deployment scenarios repository on Github (please be sure to check the contribution guidelines).
- You can also share it via this form for the Data Space Radar on IDSA Website. While filling in the form, please note that only the implementations at the pilot and live stages will be considered as IDS deployment scenarios.

# How can IDS deployment scenarios help in ensuring consistent and efficient deployment of IDS-compliant components?
IDS deployment scenarios help ensure consistency and efficiency in the deployment process by providing a structured approach. They outline prerequisites such as hardware and software requirements, configuration settings, third-party integrations, and deployment environment considerations. By following a well-defined deployment scenario, organizations can minimize errors, standardize deployment practices, and achieve reliable results across different deployments.

---

# Why is documentation important in an IDS deployment scenario?
Documentation is a critical aspect of an IDS deployment scenario to enable others to replicate the implementation. Best practices for documenting an IDS deployment scenario may include clear and detailed instructions, diagrams, and configurations. It's always better for a documentation to also include information on how to monitor and support the deployed system, troubleshoot common issues, and handle maintenance tasks. Proper documentation ensures that the deployment scenario is easily understandable and reproducible by others.

---

# What should I do if I encounter an issue while implementing an IDS deployment scenario?
If you encounter an issue during the implementation of an IDS deployment scenario, it is recommended to first refer to the documentation and instructions provided in the scenario. If the issue persists, you can reach out to the provider of the IDS deployment scenario for assistance. This can be done through channels such as email or creating an issue on GitHub, which allows others to see the question and use it as guidance if they encounter a similar issue. Collaborating with the provider and seeking help from the community can help resolve issues and ensure successful deployment.

---

# What are the key considerations for selecting an appropriate IDS deployment scenario for my data space implementation?
When selecting an IDS deployment scenario for your data space implementation, it is important to consider factors such as the specific requirements and goals of your implementation, the technical capabilities of your infrastructure, the level of expertise of your team, and the expected scale and complexity of the deployment. Additionally, considering factors such as the documentation, support, and community engagement provided by the deployment scenario can also be beneficial in making an informed decision.

---

# How can I ensure that the IDS deployment scenario I choose is compliant with the International Data Spaces (IDS) standards?
To ensure that the IDS deployment scenario you choose is compliant with the IDS standards, it is important to verify that it follows the guidelines and recommendations provided by the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA). This may include checking for compatibility with IDS specifications and requirements (on IDS-G) and creating a plan towards IDS certification.

---

# What is the difference between an IDS deployment scenario and an IDS testbed?
It is possible to view the IDS Testbed deployments through the IDS Reference Testbed repository. This repository provides access to information on the different IDS Testbed deployments, including their specifications, configurations, and functionalities.

It is important to note that what is referred to as Testbeds in the context of IDS are the deployments of the IDS Reference Test Bed (with or without modifications), and are not implemented or maintained by the International Dataspaces Association (IDSA). Instead, these Test Beds are deployed and maintained by third-party organizations that are interested in experimenting with IDS-based solutions. The IDSA provides guidance and support to these organizations to ensure that these Test Beds meet the required standards and specifications. By leveraging the IDS Testbed, organizations can gain valuable insights and experience in developing IDS-based solutions, and contribute to the advancement of this emerging technology.
