# Assessment Criteria for IDS Deployment Scenarios

## Purpose of the Document
IDS Deployment Scenarios show examples of implementations that apply IDS standard. This document shows the maturity assessment criteria based on which the IDS Deployment Scenarios are classified under three levels: Sandbox, Incubating and Graduated.


## Project Stages

### Sandbox Stage
The IDS Deployment Scenarios in Sandbox stage are:
- Deployments that are designed to extend one or more IDSA projects with functionality or interoperability libraries. 
- Independent deployments that fit the IDSA mission and provide the potential for a novel approach to existing functional areas (or are an attempt to meet an unfulfilled need).
- Deployments commissioned or sanctioned by the IDSA, including initial code for IDSA WG collaborations, and “experimental” projects.
- Any deployment that realistically intends to join IDSA Incubation in future and wishes to lay the foundations for that.
- Pilots, research projects or work that are in progress 

:information_source: The term **"deployment"** refers to a set of components. So, a deployment scenario should consist of multiple components that enable data sharing in a secure and sovereign way, as described by IDS standards.

The IDS Deployment Scenarios in Sandbox stage, do not necessarily have to be consisted of certified components. 

### Incubating Stage
Incubating deployments have proven their compatibility (based on IDS Certification), reliability, vision and mission. These deployments consist of the ones that are close to real use. 

In addition to the criteria mentioned in Sandbox stage, Incubating stage also requires deployments to:  
- Have a test conducted via IDS Testbed
- Have a clear plan towards IDS Certification 

### Graduation Stage
Graduated deployments signal the highest level of maturity for an IDSA project. They consist of productive environments that have achieved a broad acceptance and adoption by organizations. 

In addition to the criteria mentioned in Sandbox stage, Incubating stage also requires deployments to:  
- Have IDS Certification (for components and operational environments)
- Adopted by multiple organizations and already enabling data sharing in a secure and sovereign way, as defined by IDS standards.


## How Can I Have My IDS Deployment Scenario Evaluated? 
All IDS Deployment Scenarios can be submitted via the [Data Space Radar form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=NNZGs_usx0K9RPFVfuibG3WVHeFvj2hHgjU7ZCgshUhUMExMOTdCWDNMSERJTjlIUlRKMVc0QTUxMCQlQCN0PWcu). 

Following this, the maturity assessment of a IDS Deployment Scenario is made in the IDSA Ecosystem Building Calls (also known as "Monday Morning Calls") that take place on Monday mornings (09:00-10:00 CET/CEST). These meetings consist of data space experts from various organizations within the IDSA Network. 

If you would be interested in participating to these meetings please send an email to: [carlos.gonzalez@internationaldataspaces.org](mailto:carlos.gonzalez@internationaldataspaces.org)

Basically, the evaluation process consists of four steps explained below:

:one: Submit the IDS Deployment Scenario via the [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=NNZGs_usx0K9RPFVfuibG3WVHeFvj2hHgjU7ZCgshUhUMExMOTdCWDNMSERJTjlIUlRKMVc0QTUxMCQlQCN0PWcu)

:two: Declare interest for your IDS Deployment Scenario to be evaluated in IDSA Ecosystem Building Calls. If your IDS Deployment Scenario is already part of the Data Space Radar, then you can simply send an email to [carlos.gonzalez@internationaldataspaces.org](mailto:carlos.gonzalez@internationaldataspaces.org) to request for evaluation of your IDS Deployment Scenario.

:three: Pitch your project in one of the IDSA Ecosystem Building Calls

:four: Have the community vote on your deployment scenario

In addition to the evaluation criteria for each stage (that are mentioned below) an evaluation must have:
- At least 2/3 supermajority of votes (a minimum of 15 positive votes is required)
	voters should consist of people who are not: 
	a) employees or board members of IDSA
	b) an employee or associated person to the applying organization that owns the deployment scenario

In case if the minimum number of voters (15) can not be secured within a session of IDSA Ecosystem Building Calls, the voting will be conducted in the next available session, where the minimum number of voters can be granted.

Every IDS Deployment Scenario has an associated maturity level. Proposed IDS Deployment Scenarios should state their preferred maturity level. 
Projects that achieve the sandbox, incubating or graduation status are listed on the [IDS Deployment Scenarios repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-Deployment-Scenarios)

 
### Sample Evaluation Criteria for Each Stage

#### Sandbox
- Does the deployment scenario involve (or plans to involve) data sharing in a secure and sovereign way, as defined by IDS standards?
- Does the deployment scenario involve the use of IDS components?  

#### Incubation (in addition to the criteria mentioned in Sandbox)
- Has the IDS Testbed been used at any stage of this deployment scenario? (e.g. for testing component behaviour and/or interoperability) 
- Is there a plan (or expressed intention) towards IDS Certification? 

#### Graduation (in addition to the criteria mentioned in Incubation)
- Are the components and working environment certified?
- Is it already being used and adopted by multiple organizations?
